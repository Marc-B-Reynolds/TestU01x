Modified version of the standard PRNG testsuite TestU01 (http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html) based on version 1.2.3 (2009)

* Added the adaptive crush test suite (http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/ADAPTIVE)

* Removed autoconf and TeX preprocessing.
* Temp Visual Studio project files, might motivate myself to do cmake at some point
